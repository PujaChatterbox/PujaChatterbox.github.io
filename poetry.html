         Velvet Voice -
I always fall into the trap of a velvety voice. Since childhood, Maa has said and shaped me, saying Good Girls always listen." But she never said to belief. Having a bad habit of listening gifted me unnecessary patience and foolish empathy. Sounds bizarre, right? but it's abhorrent. Anyone who tells stories, one after another, linked or not, I listen, I understand, and when they do it repeatedly, I start believing in them.
It's petrifying that we are conditioned like this. Out of all our senses, we should rely on touching, but guess what? One can only feel it without any profound proof. Then the opinions are null and void. When you understand the matter of fact, things are done. I've always taken great pride in being a good listener, a late reactor, and a quick absorber. Which leads to way more trusting the sources. Every day our energy seeps out, so to regulate things under control, I opted for Ultra calmness and fake smartness. Smart who understands. But no, try not to.
I watched Afwaah by Mr. Sudhir Mishra. I do think 2023 has a lot more to say. I hope everyone finds the purple zone soon. Hazaron khawahishein aisi, Dharavi, Serious Men Chameli, and Inkaar I consider them my personal Hindi-language films. Where the colors and characters are indecipherable, and listening. I loved it, kept it, and locked it. Try to act assertive so that I can also be attractiveðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
Silently peeped into Netflix.
Ask yourself: Do you want to be a noise or a voice?
I listen to everything!

         Happy Birthday Madam! I can write paras with all those jargons or poetry on your appreciation. Your energy is calming and divine, you are so normal, palpable that I can feel my veins are making a way out of everything. Your aura resonates and meets mine somewhere in eternity. Your films define my silent callous nature. We know the language was never based on us, the gaze will always be objectifying. Maybe that's why we stand strong as characters- the driving force, catalyst, body, bearer, desire of image or desirous image. And that hell of narrative where we bring beauty. We  are performative, indecipherable, indelible, hieroglyphic scapegoats whose theology nobody wants to read as reason of castration. We signify what not to be or how everyone should be.
Yes we are wise, and the wisdom is born of pain. Yes we have paid the price but look how much we have gained. Nothing is more dangerous than calming wind because it gives you comfort and once it is snatched away then I hope you survive. 
Cheers to everyone who is not men! Hahahaha no no cheers to this invincible purple owl madam, who reminds us to be on the ground. And wish you all the pain, patience, vulnerabilities and power!
Happy Birthday Arlette Varda Agnes
I AM SMALL.  I WAS ALWAYS SMALL. BUT ONLY PHYSICALLY.
